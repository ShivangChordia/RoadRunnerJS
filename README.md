# RoadRunnerJS
RoadRunner is an interactive web application designed to explore Dijkstra's algorithm. With RoadRunner, users can create custom graphs by adding nodes and edges, and then observe how Dijkstra's algorithm efficiently navigates through the graph to determine the shortest route between two selected nodes.
