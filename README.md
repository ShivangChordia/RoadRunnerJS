RoadRunner is an interactive web application designed to explore Dijkstra's algorithm, a fundamental method for finding the shortest path between nodes in a graph. With RoadRunner, users can create custom graphs by adding nodes and edges, and then observe how Dijkstra's algorithm efficiently navigates through the graph to determine the shortest route between two selected nodes.

*Key Features:*
1. *Graph Customization:* Users can build personalized graphs by adding nodes and defining edges along with their respective weights.
2. *Dijkstra's Algorithm Visualization:* RoadRunner provides a dynamic visualization of Dijkstra's algorithm at work, demonstrating how it iteratively explores different paths and selects the optimal one.
3. *User-Friendly Interface:* With an intuitive interface, users can interact effortlessly with the graph, choose starting and ending points, and execute the algorithm seamlessly.
4. *Path Highlighting:* Upon computation of the shortest path, RoadRunner highlights the route on the graph, allowing users to visualize the optimal path with clarity.
5. *Educational Value:* RoadRunner serves as an educational resource for individuals interested in graph theory and algorithms, offering insights and explanations to deepen understanding.

*Why RoadRunner?*
RoadRunner empowers users to experiment with graph structures and gain insights into Dijkstra's algorithm through an engaging and interactive experience. Whether you're a student exploring algorithms or a developer seeking to enhance your understanding, RoadRunner provides an exciting journey through the realm of graph theory and pathfinding algorithms.
